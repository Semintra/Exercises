        <p><span>Gazing through the window at the world outside Wondering will mother earth survive Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her Sometime</span></p>
        <p><span>After all, there's only just the two of us And here we are, still fighting for our lives Watching all of history repeat itself Time after time</span></p>
        <p><span>I'm just a dreamer I dream my life away I'm just a dreamer Who dreams of better days</span></p>
        <p><span>I watch the sun go down like everyone of us I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign A better place for those who will come after us This time</span></p>
        <p><span>I'm just a dreamer I dream my life away Oh yeah I'm just a dreamer Who dreams of better days</span></p>
        <p><span>Your higher power may be God or Jesus Christ It doesn't really matter much to me Without each other's help, there ain't no hope for us I'm living in a dream, a fantasy Oh yeahâ€¦</span></p>
